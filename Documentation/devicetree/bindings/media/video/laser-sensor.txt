Laser Sensor Device Tree Bindings.
========================================

Boards with the Laser Sensor connected to CCI shall have the following
properties:

Required node properties:
	- cell-index: cci hardware core index
	- compatible:
		- "st,stmvl53l1" : STMiecroelectronics VL53L1 Laser sensor.
	- reg : offset and length of the register set for the device
	- cci-master: cci master the sensor connected to
	- cci-device: cci device the sensor connected to
	- cci-supply : cci voltage regulator used
	- laser-supply: laser sensor voltage regulator
	- intr-gpio: irq gpio which is to provide interrupts to host
	- xsdn-gpio: laser sensor shutdown gpio
